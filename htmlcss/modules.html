JSFiddle changelog
A log of all the changes made to JSFiddle – big and small.

    New Ability to download a fiddle

    We've added the ability to download a specific fiddle version from the Editor's interface. I'll be downloaded as a Zipped single HTML file.
    New Your recent fiddles when logged out

    Saving a fiddle, even when you're logged out, will put it under the Your recent fiddles modal in the sidebar. They will eventually disappear (since they're anonymous), but now you'll have time to save them under your user after logging in.
    New Tailwind CSS

    Added Tailwind CSS to the list of precompilers - even though it's really HTML, you can activate it from the dropdown in the CSS panel. Tailwind CSS would be best used with HTML Hot-reload enabled.
    Update Code linting and formatting

    We've replaced the dated code linter and formatted with more modern ones: Stylelint and Prettier.
    New JSFiddle 3.0

    The 3.0 updates brings a lot of changes, most notably a modern UI refresh.

    There was an increadible amount of under-the-hood changes for the front-end, we've mostly moved away from pre-processors. The light/dark themes are using a modern light-dark() approach. The refactoring allows for more changes to be made in a spedier manner.

        In the new sidebar you can find our mini-apps (right now the Color Palette Generator)

        System theme follows your OS settings

        CSS Hot-reload - styles update immidietly as you type

        HTML Hot-reload (experimental) - update HTML immidietly as you type

        Results panel color follows the selected theme

        Title and description are now a single field

        Public Profile page is completelty redesigned and can be easily used as your code showcase

        Groups are now Collections and we have big plans for them

        Collections are completely redesigned

        Users can now add groups straight from the editor
    New Import fiddles as modules

    Import fiddle code into other fiddles with Modules and Imports.

    JS Modules: import [name] from '@jsfiddle/[username]/[fiddle].js'

    CSS Import: @import url('@jsfiddle/[username]/[fiddle].css')

    See how this works in this fiddle.
    Change Fiddle listing shows latest version

    The fiddle listings (Public, Private, Titled, etc) will now display latest versions instead of the ones saved as Base versions - this was causing more confusion than good, so we decided to change this long-standing behavior.
    Change Evaluate code into the console

    Custom Console beta is getting more stable and feature-rich. Just added the ability to evaluate code in the console.
    New Console in the editor

    Introducing the first beta of the editor console - it's going to show you logs, warnings, errors without the need of opening full devtools.

    Console is avaialble for all users during beta, after that it'll be available for JSFiddle supporters.
    New More user's social links (Dev.to, Stack Overflow, Medium)

    You can add more of your social links `Settings / Social Media`, for Dev.to, Stack Overflow and Medium. These will be displayed on the profile section in Editor's sidebar and your public profile.
    Change Refactored Unsaved Drafts feature

    Unsaved drafts feature is completely rewritten with 100% fewer bugs and 10x more maintainable codebase – as the author of the previous one, I had hard times figuring out what it does 🥴

Add a new collection
Collect your fiddles in collections
