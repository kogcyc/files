let's say that I have two circles that are of the same radius which is 20

let us also say that the two circles are centered at Cartesian points 0,0 and 50,0

are you good so far?
ChatGPT

Yes, I understand. You have two circles with a radius of 20 units each. One circle is centered at the point (0, 0), and the other is centered at (50, 0) on the Cartesian plane. How can I assist you further with this problem?
You said:
is it possible for you to imagine that there is a shape, a line, if you will, that is shaped like  a string that runs around both circles, forming a 'oval' shape that is not elliptical, but shaped like a 'running track'?
ChatGPT

Yes, I can visualize the shape you're describing. It's a figure formed by wrapping a string tightly around both circles of radius 20 units centered at (0, 0) and (50, 0). The resulting shape resembles a running track: two semicircular ends connected by straight lines tangent to the circles. This shape is often referred to as a stadium or discorectangle.

Understanding the Shape:

    Semicircular Ends: Each circle contributes a semicircular arc to the shape.
    Straight Sides: The straight lines connect the endpoints of the semicircles and are tangent to the circles.

Mathematical Properties:

    Perimeter (Circumference):

    The perimeter PP of the stadium shape is the sum of the lengths of the two semicircles and the two straight sides.
        Length of the two semicircles (which make a full circle):
        Pcircle=2πr=2π×20=40π
        Pcircle​=2πr=2π×20=40π
        Length of the two straight sides:
        Pstraight=2×distance between the points of tangency
        Pstraight​=2×distance between the points of tangency The distance between the points of tangency is equal to the distance between the circle centers minus twice the radius:
        Length of one straight side=(50−2×20)=10 units
        Length of one straight side=(50−2×20)=10 units So,
        Pstraight=2×10=20 units
        Pstraight​=2×10=20 units
        Total Perimeter:
        P=Pcircle+Pstraight=40π+20
        P=Pcircle​+Pstraight​=40π+20

    Area:

    The area AA of the stadium shape is the sum of the area of the rectangle and the areas of the two semicircles (which make a full circle).
        Area of the rectangle:
        Arectangle=length×width=10×40=400 square units
        Arectangle​=length×width=10×40=400 square units
        Area of the circle:
        Acircle=πr2=π×202=400π square units
        Acircle​=πr2=π×202=400π square units
        Total Area:
        A=Arectangle+Acircle=400+400π
        A=Arectangle​+Acircle​=400+400π

    Equations of the Boundary:
        Left Semicircle (center at (0,0)(0,0)):
        (x)2+y2=202forx≤0orx≥0
        (x)2+y2=202forx≤0orx≥0
        Right Semicircle (center at (50,0)(50,0)):
        (x−50)2+y2=202
        (x−50)2+y2=202
        Straight Lines (connecting the semicircles):
            Top Line:
            y=20fromx=20tox=30
            y=20fromx=20tox=30
            Bottom Line:
            y=−20fromx=20tox=30
            y=−20fromx=20tox=30

    However, since the circles are 50 units apart and have a radius of 20 units, the straight sides are between x=20x=20 and x=30x=30.

Visualization:

    The shape extends from x=0x=0 to x=50x=50.
    The straight sides are between x=20x=20 and x=30x=30.
    The maximum and minimum yy-values are y=20y=20 and y=−20y=−20.

Further Discussion:

    Applications: This shape is commonly used in athletics track design and in mechanical components like cams and pistons.
    Calculus Applications: You can compute moments of inertia, centroid locations, or analyze the shape's properties under transformations.
