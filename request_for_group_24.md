Exciting news! Our first initiative for 2024 is to offer a <b><i>group-buy</i></b> frame and fork set.

To get things started, we're asking potential buyers to tell us what they are looking for in a frameset:

- how will this frame be used?
- should we use steel or aluminum?
- what size frame and wheels do you want?
- etc?

Your answers will guide what we build.

So here's your chance to make history. Please take the survey below so that we can get some samples into the hands of the reviewers.

Thanks!
