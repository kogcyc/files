On the Raspberry Pi, you need to enable USB networking.
This can typically be done by editing the config.txt file 
on the boot partition of the SD card. Add the following lines:

      dtoverlay=dwc2

And in the cmdline.txt file, add the following at the end of the line:

      modules-load=dwc2,g_ether
